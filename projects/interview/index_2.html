    <div class="interview">
      <p>
        <div class="neeta">Here we go. How are you doing?</div>
        <div>Pretty good. I don't know, just took the day to get ready for the rest of the week, really.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, and you're located in Canada?</div>
        <div>I was. I'm in Maryland now.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Nice. I'm in Connecticut.
          Um I have a bunch of questions I'd love to ask you, just sort of about your experience and your interest in type design, and then maybe I can show you the roughest of drafts I have going for the website for this interview.
        </div>
        <div>Cool.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Cool. so I guess I should start off. So I've sort of found out about you and your work through just through Instagram and the internet. I've recently been pretty interested in Gujarati type design. I don't really know anything about type design, but Gujarati is like my family's language and, um, I don't know just Googling around. And then I remember I reached out to Tanvi Sharma to sort of ask for advice and maybe names of people and she suggested that I get in touch with you. Yeah I love going on your Instagram. It's just, it's really hard, I think, to find reference points, at least from my corner of the world, on like Gujarati type and Gujarati designers. So anyway, I was just curious if you could start off by telling me about just sort of how you, how you started off in graphic design or sort of what led you to become a type designer. And also, just sort of what types of design work you do.</div>
        <div>
          Yeah, sure. Well, I guess, I mean. I guess I've always been a pretty artistic person. Like since I was a kid. And I started doing like design or like experimenting with design, when I was in like the ninth grade, I think. I had like a pirated version of Photoshop, which my dad just randomly gave to me, one day, like I had my own computer in my room and then he installed it. And I just like started playing around with it, and like literally, the reason I wanted to do it was so that I could change the color of my eyes in photos that like you know . . . I was 14 years old, I wanted green eyes. So I was doing stupid shit like that.
          Yeah just following like all these online tutorials. So I just like learned how to do a bunch of stuff like that, And then in high school like I was the person everyone came to to make posters for like events, or stuff like that. I don't know if this happened, like when you were in high school, but like when it was somebody's birthday, like you, decorated the lockers.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh yeah! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, we did do that.</div>
        <div>Yeah so I used to like design, like the 8.5 x 11 pages for like the whole like locker. So I used to do that for like all my friends and stuff. I was like Yearbook editor in grade 12, and yeah I mean that was like when I basically figured out like, 'Oh, like design is a thing. This is actually a job that people have in the real world.' Before that I thought I was going to go to like, journalism. I actually did co-op for like journalism and photography.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh cool. </div>
        <div>Yeah, which is where I learned like how to do retouching and stuff like that. That was actually super helpful.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, get those green eyes really perfect.</div>
        <div>
          Ha ha, yeah. And then yeah I was in like my last year of high school when I decided, like I found a program in Toronto. I don't know if you've ever heard of YSDN? That's the York Sheridan program. I think actually as of this year, it is like done, like it's not going to be a program anymore, but it was basically like a joint program with York University and Sheridan college. It was like very hands on, but it was still at the university level. I was super interested in it. And yeah it was all like design focused, like there was no like fine arts focus on it, which I really liked because I'm very bad at like fine art skills, like, I never took art or anything. So yeah, that's like what led me to that program.
          And then I actually really hated typography.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, no way.</div>
        <div>Yeah it was not my favorite class. I remember the first project we did I like got the size wrong of the project, and I presented it. And yeah I just got like, my prof just like tore me down, and I like cried.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh no! That sounds awful.</div>
        <div>
          Yeah I was like, I'm over typography, this is not for me. But then, I don't know, when I was in my third year there was like a typeface design course. And I was just so intrigued by it, because it's so different from type setting. So I just decided to check it out, and I really loved it. And I actually think a big part of that was the prof that I had. She was very open-minded.
          So when I, so I ended up actually asking her at the beginning of the semester, like instead of designing like a Latin font can I do Gujarati instead, because, like I'm just more interested in that.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>And she didn't like - she was white - so she didn't know anything about Gujarati. But she was very open to just like letting me explore it. That's how I started like with typography or typeface design and like Gujarati specifically.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Had you designed any Latin typefaces before that, or you just went straight into Gujarati?</div>
        <div>Yeah yeah. I mean I've had like bubble letters that's probably as far as I had done. I mean the typeface was awful because I had no resources, I didn't know where to even start with Gujarati.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah and it sounds like your professor wasn't necessarily the expert in the field on that one.</div>
        <div>No. Like she was great with Latin, but obviously not with Gujarati. I just like had this like weird little process that I came up with for it. And I like found some books and stuff,, but you know, looking at a book that's written in Gujarati isn't super informative if you don't know how to actually analyze it.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Mm hmm.</div>
        <div>So that was how I got really interested in like pursuing typeface design further because I was like I know this isn't great, but I want to learn how to make it better.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, totally.</div>
        <div>I ended up doing like an independent study in typeface design in my last year of university as well. </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh wow.</div>
        <div>So that was really cool like it was just like about the history of like or like the development of the Gujarati script.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Okay.</div>
        <div>Again, I was like pretty limited with resources. But it was like, it was cool. I still got to learn a lot more.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Totally. Was that a - did that culminate in some sort of like paper or dissertation?</div>
        <div>Not a dissertation. It was, well, I guess, like an essay essentially. But it was like a design, like booklet type of thing.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Oh cool, if it's at all possible, or if you don't mind sharing that, I would love to learn about the development of that script.
          But no pressure, I'm just curious.
        </div>
        <div>I'll see if I can find it. It was not super comprehensive. I can actually send you a dissertation on the development of the Gujarati script instead, by somebody who did it for their Master's.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh interesting, yeah.</div>
        <div>That one is actually very good. Mine was just like . . . oh God, it almost just felt like a high school project. Now that I think about it. Yeah I mean, basically both of those classes, that I took like got me really interested in typeface design. And my prof told me about the grad program at Reading. I was really interested in it, and I actually ended up reaching out to the prof about applying like you know. You know, what my chances were of getting in and he was basically just like, um, you have potential, but you need more practice. So I ended up doing Type at Cooper.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, okay, yeah.</div>
        <div>Yeah so I ended up doing that in 2017. And that was like in preparation for applying to Reading.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Got it.</div>
        <div> Yeah.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Sounds like it worked.</div>
        <div>Yeah, thankfully. And then that's basically how I ended up at Reading. This prof basically just told me like a bunch of things that I could do to like get more experience and like get a better portfolio. And I just I think it took me about four years to just get everything together that I wanted.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Wow.</div>
        <div>Yeah, and then to get the guts to just like reapply properly this time. And then 2019 is when did grad school, finished in the end of 2020.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Okay. It's a one year program, or?</div>
        <div>Yeah it's like a full - it's like two years condensed, so it's like a full one year program.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Wow, that sounds really intense. What did you think of that experience as a whole? I mean it also sounds like you were there during part of the pandemic.</div>
        <div>Yeah, so I was there . . . I got there like six months before the pandemic started.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh wow okay.</div>
        <div>Yeah yeah, so like it was really great when it was in person. It was like a really small class. I think there was like 12 of us to begin with. So it was very small very like intimate and you know, I had access to, like so many things I didn't have before - like it was INSANE.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah. I mean the program is like entirely devoted to type design, right?</div>
        <div>Yes, yeah.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Wow. That's really cool, though.</div>
        <div> It's like you are creating a whole tape face with like multiple styles, multiple languages, and then you're also writing a dissertation towards the end of the program as well. So it's like very intense because it's like a lot to do in such a short amount of time. But there's like a ton of workshops and like lectures and like special guests and things like that, that we got to experience, which was really nice. Even through the pandemic and, like the switch to like learning online, like it was difficult, but like it like we did the best we could, with what we had and it like, it worked out.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, made the best of it.</div>
        <div>Yeah yeah it's a good - it was a good - like I don't regret going. Had fun, even.</div>
        <div class="neeta">That's amazing. I'm curious also about - and I ask this as something I'm also kind of trying to figure out or think about - what your relationship to the Gujarati language is and how it maybe has changed, as you dove into it through type design as well.</div>
        <div>Yeah I mean so like I'm Gujarati as well, and so like I grew up speaking Gujarati mostly just like to my grandparents, like basic. I was also in Gujarati school like from a young age, so like I learned how to like read and write.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh that's amazing. And this is in Canada, or?</div>
        <div>Yeah. So it was just like Friday nights and then, when I was in high school it was like Saturday mornings. So I only did it up until like the 10th grade, I think.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Still, that sounds like a number of years.</div>
        <div>Yeah, I did it for quite a long time, which makes it surprising that I'm not more fluent in Gujarati, ha ha. It was just always something that was like around in some shape or form in my life. I mean part of the reason I also wanted to do like typeface design and specifically focus on Gujarati was so I felt like I had more of a connection to my culture and like to like the Indian - like my Indian background because, like, I have always felt like a little not embarrassed but, just like -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>You know, I'm Indian and I feel like I should be able to speak Gujarati more, or be more fluent with it. This is my way of like just connecting, I don't know, with that with that side of me. You know, if I can't be super fluent in speaking Gujarati then I can at least like design it, and I can learn how to read it even better.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah. 'At least' being the understatement of the year there. It's such a big thing to be able to design that script.</div>
        <div>Yeah. I mean it was it was something that I found I was good at, and that I enjoyed, so I was like, 'Okay well I can't like speak it super well, but at least I can design it kind of well.'</div>
        <div class="neeta">Sure, yeah.</div>
        <div>
          But it's nice. Like now, I feel like I can definitely read a lot quicker than I was able to before. Even like, I can read like Hindi because they're so similar. I've been able to pick up reading Hindi pretty well. And stuff like that.
          And yeah, I don't know. It made me want to even like watch Gujarati movies, which I never had an interest in before, but I was like, I wanna watch a Gujarati movie, and like keep the subtitles on just so like I can see if I can keep up with it. That kind of thing.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Wow. I can't express to you right now how much I empathize with everything you just said, of like not being very fluent in Gujarati but it's all around me at home, and just all of it. Like truly all of it. And then last semester, when I first - I was um - I forget how much I described to you what I was working on, but, basically, I was typesetting an essay by Gandhi in Gujarati.</div>
        <div> Oh, okay.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          And I also like did like nowhere near as much schooling as you, but like a very little bit through the local mandir, and um, anyway, I'm not very good at reading, but just doing that typesetting and trying to figure out what the letters were, I feel like I'm just even a little bit better at reading, and it's just so exciting - it feels like a real deep connection like with a past that I don't really know anything about in terms of my parents, and it's sort of like - it's so gratifying.
          I'm curious also, how like, how important you think it is to have, not even like fluency in written language but, just like how important is a familiarity with it when you're working as a type designer in the script? Like did you ever feel - did you feel very comfortable designing Gujarati right out of the gate or did you feel some like hesitancy? Or sort of, yeah.
        </div>
        <div>Yeah I mean, I think because I was familiar with it, I felt very comfortable with it in a way that like at least one I got to grad school, I felt very comfortable with it in a way that, like my classmates who were designing maybe like Hindi or Arabic, for the first time didn't. Like they were not native speakers of that language. And so I think it is very helpful because there's just like small things about the language and, like the orthography and stuff that like you just like inherently know if you've learned even a little bit of it.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Right.</div>
        <div>
          You know, just things like the vowels and the placements - like that just makes sense to me because I've grown up with it. I know that the ઈ can go on either side of the letter. And I know the difference between the two, and like why there's two ઈ characters and things like that. So like, being comfortable with it, and knowing it, I did find that to be an advantage, which was good.
          Yeah. This is also like a pretty common topic I think in the type design industry, in general, if, like, you know, should designers be designing for languages that they have no connection to? It's kind of like a spicy topic. People have very strong opinions about it because, like, it's hard to find native designers for every single language.
          And then, but then there's like white designers who have made their entire career off of designing like Hindi or Devanagari, right?
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Right.</div>
        <div>
          But it's like, you know, especially like you know, two summers ago when everything happened with George Floyd, and all these racial conversation started happening like it was a really big issue, then for people asking like who should be designing typefaces for these languages?
          And, yeah, so I mean I don't know if I have like a stance on it, like a very strong stance on it, but it definitely does help, when designing at least, if you're familiar.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah. You have an insight into sort of how this thing functions on a very vernacular level, I guess.</div>
        <div> Yeah.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Which is yeah really helpful. Do you think that conversation has kept up in type design as a whole in the last two years?</div>
        <div>I think it has a little bit, but just like I don't know. I do think it's like sort of died down the same way, like the same the other conversations that we were having around race at that time have sort of died down. Which I just, which I find crazy. But it's I don't know. It sucks but it's not a thing that people are focusing on anymore.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Mm hmm.</div>
        <div>From what I can see, but I do think there is more initiatives at least to get like type design education in like these more remote places So like, in Southeast Asia, for example, like that was a big area where it was like just white designers for the longest time, were designing like Thai or Burmese or whatever. And now there's like some type design education that's happening in those areas.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Small steps, I guess.
          I'm just looking down at my little notes I took before we got on the call.
          I'm curious also what sort of I something I enjoy about your instagram is that I can - when I was getting into this whole subject area I felt like you had a lot of references on there - well, not past tense - have a lot of references on there to sort of like things you're looking at. Like I remember one post in particular was about a sari design. Like picture of the fabric you posted. And I was like oh my God, of course this is also design. And so I'm just curious to hear sort of where you look for inspiration, and not necessarily just in designing typefaces, but just design at large, like sort of inspiration and also reference points.
        </div>
        <div>
          Yeah. So recently for type stuff I do like to go to Letterform Archive. They have an online archive now which I, I find myself going to a lot if I'm just like I just want to browse like type-related stuff. Because they have a really big catalog, so I go there a lot. For like more of like the Indian stuff, and like the Gujarati, I have like I have a lot of books of my own. You know, like books that were passed down and stuff as well. As well as, like some of the sari stuff that you mentioned, like those are just like my mom sari's that I just like decided one day to take pictures of. I just had a feeling like one day I might reference these, in the future for something or like want to.
          Um, and then I don't know, what else?
          Sometimes, like the last Instagram post was literally a picture I took of like water drying on the ground.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, that almost looks like a painting.</div>
        <div>
          Yeah! I love the way that the water was like making like almost like a gradient like it was like yeah it was just like - I don't know - it caught my eye.
          I do like, I end up taking a lot of random pictures just like out in the world, because I'm like I think I may want to use this like in something way down the line, who knows. So I do try to like reference from like my environment.
          And then, like it feels like a bit of a cheat code or whatever, but like referencing like mid-century designers, right? Like they're so good. They were, you can't go wrong when you're referencing them, right?
          I also really like to reference textiles and ornamental architecture.
          So, like inlays, like specifically like floral inlays and stuff. I love that. Because it's so prevalent in Indian architecture, too.
        </div>
        <div> class="neeta"Oh, that's so interesting yeah.</div>
        <div>I have a book, I can like send you the name of it, or like send you a picture of, um -</div>
        <div class="neeta">I'd love that.</div>
        <div>I reference that so much. I got it when I was at Type of Cooper. I went to the Met by myself one day and I found this book on Indian ornamental patterns and stuff - and like it was crazy! It was so cool.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          That sounds lovely. It's really, really nice - I feel like as I'm just starting to get serious about my design education it's become clear that, like to cultivate some sort of base of like where you look, particularly if you're stuck or something like that, is so critical and I just feel like it's a glaring hole in my life, and it's so it's so lovely of you to share where you look.
          Um, I guess my one of my last questions is: Do you - and I ask this in a very personal way - basically do you have advice for someone who is just getting into type design, has never really designed typefaces, and wants to design a Gujarati typeface? Ha ha. Um, just sort of like, I feel very few bewildered because it's such a huge world and I don't even know the basic fundamentals of like Latin type design, which is my first language. Um. So yeah just sort of like any advice about how to get started.
        </div>
        <div>Yes, definitely! And I guess the first question, I have, though, is are you also designing like a companion Latin typeface, or like just pure Gujarati?</div>
        <div class="neeta">That's a good question. Um basically, well, I haven't really embarked on a project yet, and I actually won't like formally do it until next year, like the second year of my program, and that will be a Latin typeface. It's gonna have to be. But, I just want to like get a jumpstart and I don't have a clue how.</div>
        <div>I mean, for the Latin stuff, I can totally send you some resources. There's one book in particular that I used to use. Oh yeah I don't think I mentioned this, I also taught typeface design like at my the university that I also attended in underground. Like I ended up teaching part-time like typography and typeface design. So I did my undergrad and stuff and I took typegface design and then a couple years later I ended up coming back to teach in the same Program.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh wow, very cool.</div>
        <div>I taught typeface design, so I can send you a bunch of resources from that time. There's one book in particular that I recommend heavily for like first time like Latin typeface design. </div>
        <div class="neeta">Amazing.</div>
        <div> So I'll send that to you.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, thank you! That sounds like exactly what I need.</div>
        <div>And then for Gujarati type design, um, I think the first thing you have to think about is, are you designing for display or are you designing for text? Display being like a  more ornamental like fun typeface, I guess.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Mm hmm.</div>
        <div>And text being like something that you would want to read like large passages of text in. So that's the first thing. If you're doing display, like, there's so many things you can reference. I like to reference for display design like for Gujarati like um, book covers, like the min-century book covers! Like they're crazy, they're so good, they're -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Like, Gujarati book covers?</div>
        <div>Yeah - </div>
        <div class="neeta">Where do you find these??</div>
        <div>There's a Flickr album that this typeface designer uploaded with a bunch of like Gujarati book covers, but then she -</div>
        <div class="neeta">No way!!</div>
        <div>- also has a ton of of other languages. So she has like Devanagari, Gurmukhi, Tamil, Telugu, all of this stuff like yeah it's pretty crazy. So I can send you a link to that.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, that would be awesome.</div>
        <div>But if you're doing - what I would basically recommend is starting with the text because the base of that is Gujarati calligraphy, and like Gujarati writing.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Mm hmm.</div>
        <div>So when you know, like how to do Gujarati calligraphy even just like the basic strokes, that you would need and, like, the angle at which the pen should be, that gives you such a good basis for even just like the skeletons of the letters that you're going to design. Because Gujarati calligraphy was done like with a reed pen.</div>
        <div class="neeta">I didn't know that.</div>
        <div>They were done with a reed pen that have like that angle, right?</div>
        <div class="neeta">So it's like fat at moments, and then really thin in other moments?</div>
        <div>Yeah, do you know, what the Pilot Parallel pens are?</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, they're like super flat, thick and flat, right?</div>
        <div>Yeah. So Pilot Parallel pens are really good as well. I actually like to just use highlighters.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh! Ha ha.</div>
        <div>Because they are cut at the perfect like angle like there's like that chisel tip -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>- that is a good angle, and then I hold it like I hold them like a pen, like where the correct angle should be and then I just draw on paper using that because it's such an easy way to just like experiment, and like it's like low pressure.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Right, yeah.</div>
        <div>It's just a highlighter. You're not like using pen and ink. So I actually think on Instagram I have a little guide for -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh no way.</div>
        <div>
          - Gujarati, for starting with - let me find it.
          Yes.
          So it's the - I'll just send it to you.
          So this, like, two pencil method - that is actually something that I use a lot. So literally just taping together to pencils because then you can create like whichever angle you need.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh wow this is so - um - just like lo-fi. Also very cute guide.</div>
        <div>Yeah, ha ha. So I think the last, or one of the last -</div>
        <div class="neeta">This is awesome.</div>
        <div>Yeah, so in the third slide, the third square, um the 36 degrees. So that's like you're holding your pen like if you were to line up the two ends of your pencil tips with that angle like that's how you would want to keep the pencils, or like whatever writing utensil that you're using.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>
          And that's essentially the starting point for writing in the Gujarati script.
          A big mistake that a lot of people make when they try to learn Gujarati calligraphy, or like calligraphy in other languages that don't follow what like Latin does, is they use the Latin angle, which is essentially the exact opposite of what you need for Gujarati, so then your thicks and thins are in the wrong place.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh wow.</div>
        <div>And then it ends up looking like very weird, it's like a Romanized or Latinized version of Gujarati that like isn't super true to how it works.</div>
        <div class="neeta">So interesting. How important do you think it is to be good at drawing or calligraphy? I'm not very skilled this.</div>
        <div> It's not super important. It's more just like you, if you understand how the letters work and how the letters should be formed, like understanding the structure and the way the letters should be formed is more important than like being able to draw it perfectly because you can always like go back in with your pencil after and like, you know, fix it, erase what didn't work or, like, if you're working digitally you can very easily fix those things. It's more about like, 'Okay, I got the general placement of the thicks and thins in the right spots. So I'd say like yeah, because I'm not like, I said I'm not -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Ha ha, yeah I was thinking about -</div>
        <div>I'm not an artist.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Ha ha, sounds familiar. </div>
        <div>So if you can just familiar with that . . . I know it's so difficult to just like explain over video it's so much easier to show you.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, but even this diagram on this post is so helpful.</div>
        <div>Yeah, I'll send you like, whatever I can, with the calligraphy stuff. The other thing I would say to do is like just find a typeface. Even maybe an old one from a book or something that you could just start copying in like Glyphs or something, just to like get you familiar with how to like place points for like doing vector drawing for typeface design.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Mm hmm.</div>
        <div>And then it'll also help you to just be like a character study of like all the different letters that you have to design.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Right.</div>
        <div>Yeah, what else?</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, that sounds good. Copying. That sounds like a lot less, um, I'm just feeling like a lot of pressure about like oh my God, if I start this like project it's going to have to be something worth doing, but like you got to learn some how, basically.</div>
        <div>I can yeah I would I would start like yeah with copying and like there's a like a core set of characters that you can start with that'll give you a lot of what you need to design the rest of the letters. So don't feel like you have to start like from ક and then do every single letter.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Okay.</div>
        <div>What you can do instead is like - so we call them proof of concept, where you would just do like a sample. Like of you know, maybe like 10 to 15 letters and it'll give you like the DNA of the font, right? And that's just like a very easy way to explore like different ideas you have, rather than like doing a full typeface, and it does show like a wider range of skill as well.</div>
        <div class="neeta">That smaller set?</div>
        <div> Yeah. </div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>I think like - I don't know if this is applicable to you because - I don't think - I don't know if you've ever like - want to go to like grad school for typeface design or anything, but like I know a lot of students in typeface design or like that want to go into typeface design think they need to have designed like a FULL typeface with like every single like punctuation, every single letter possible, and all of that, but like really like it's just about showing - it's better to show range and that you've thought about like designing a typeface, that is, is for like display, one that is for text, one that has a lot of contrast, one that maybe doesn't. And so yeah, I just recommend doing that because, like you get a lot more exposure to different styles.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Right, yeah, you can sort of "end" things a little quicker and move on to the next idea almost.</div>
        <div>
          Yeah, because it's more important to do that, rather than like . . . what are you going to do with a fully finished Gujarati typeface? That is probably not, you know, you're probably not going to sell it, right? If you're just making it as a learning tool. I can't tell you how many type faces I have that I started that . . . yeah yeah.
          But no, oh my God, I feel like I'm rambling about -
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Oh no, I'm so happy to hear it. Don't worry about it. This is all fantastic.
          Um, yeah, maybe um let me show you - uh - what I have going for this site so far, and it's like - I cannot express how sketchy it is - ha ha. It is bound to change a million times, but um. I was sort of thinking - please excuse the horrendous typography on this page - Actually, this is the second idea I had. The first idea I had was - if you're interested at all - I thought it could be cool to make this, like I mentioned, a very type-heavy little website, but also to showcase like a Gujarati typeface you've worked on, or something you're interested in, in that realm. Um, so this is just like a random Google font - actually the font is called Shrikhand, which I thought was really fun, super display - but um, anyway, so I like this idea of having these little cards, with all the letters and then maybe I'll fit in the content sort of on separate cards - like this is the beginning of a card - OR have content on the flip side and there's like a hover state. At least when you're on desktop.
          Yeah and this I just pulled off your Instagram real quick to see what it would be like to have little images of like things that inspire you or like even like a link to Letterform Archive, or something like, that, interspersed. And this would be like responsive for mobile . . .
          And then the other idea I had is - I'm kind of sad in that designe to not be able to just like read our conversation. Especially because, as someone who's found it hard to find conversation about Gujarati type design, it would be cool to just have it all in one place.
          Yeah and so, then I was thinking about doing something more like a traditional typesetting of the whole interview, and then on the sidebar maybe these like individual consonants click out to like - say you click જ, it clicks out to like some point in the article that maybe relates to the sound of જ or something. Or even not necessarily a logical connection, but just this thing takes you through the interview in maybe a more unexpected way.
        </div>
        <div> Yeah! </div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Which is kind of what this thing - this thing takes you through the interview in a very unexpected way, and this thing is little more traditional.
          So I guess I'm trying to find some in-between.
        </div>
        <div>Yeah I mean I think those are both great ideas. Um. I do have a typeface, like I can give you the typeface that I worked on for my Master's -</div>
        <div class="neeta">Is this Mango?!</div>
        <div> Ha, yeah.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Ha ha, sorry not to be a total creep.</div>
        <div>No no no, that's cool. Um yeah that one is not fully done, but like I have the full basic alphabet that you would need, so I can give that to you.</div>
        <div class="neeta">That sounds awesome! The other thing our conversation just before reminded me of is if there was a typeface that you want started and didn't finish, like maybe it would be interesting to have an incomplete set of letters on there? But just totally your call.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah, I mean I definitely do. Actually, I do have like a display type basically that I started in Gujarati, like I did it just as proof of concept for my for my Master's, so I could share that with you. The letters are very random.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Cool, that could be interesting, I don't - yeah.
          It is kind of nice how ક and Keya just work out at the top of the page, so that's the only thing I'm like kind of anchored to.
          But the name Mango is such a good name for a typeface.
        </div>
        <div>Oh my God, thank you, I thought it was gonna be so cheesy like -</div>
        <div class="neeta">No! How did you come up with it?</div>
        <div>- what a diaspora ass name. But I justify it because the counters in the Latin are purposely like uneven, kind of like a mango.</div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Interesting, interesting.
          So you designed like a Latin counterpart, as well as the Gujarati. Is that sort of what is standard in type design?
        </div>
        <div>Well, it was a requirement in the program.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh, okay.</div>
        <div>
          To design like a Latin typeface and then the companion font in whatever language or languages, you wanted to design them in.
          But generally it's become more of a thing in the type world now to like to be more inclusive with like, even just your Latin character set. Like the basic like languages or regions that they would cover is like - I think it was like Eastern Europe. Like the those languages that have like diacritics and stuff. But now it's becoming more common practice to include like diacritics for things like Vietnamese because, like that's a very underserved, or was a very underserved community for typeface design.
          I don't know how much you know about Vietnamese, but like they have like diacritics that like stack. So you might have like two or three diacritics that are stacked on like one letter so like people were just very, I don't know, impatient, maybe is the right word. It's a lot of work, right? Now the conversation has shifted to being like, 'You have to put in the work if you want to be inclusive with your work, right? And not just leave out a whole population of people that need to be able to read their language.
          I mean generally like - it's not like - because I wanted to just release like Mango Gujarati by itself, but I spoke with somebody who's in the industry, and he was like you can, the likelihood of people buying just the Gujarati typeface without the English companion is like pretty low. It does make sense from like a more logical standpoint. If you're typesetting something, you would probably want to have the matching Latin because English is like THE language now of the world.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Do you work like totally professionally in type design now, or do you also do other forms of design work?</div>
        <div>
          No, actually. The only time I was working full-time in typeface design is when I was interning right after grad school. I did like a six-month internship doing typeface design, but after that - I'm actually a brand designer now for a startup.
          Yeah, so I do that full-time, but I actually do quite a bit of type design within this, so -
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Like within that branding project?</div>
        <soan> Yeah. </soan>
        <div class="neeta">Oh cool.</div>
        <div>
          Yeah.
          And then I do like freelance work as well, so I've been able to keep up with doing type design, in that way and, like, I have a lot of South Asian clients.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh that's so awesome, yeah.</div>
        <div>It's worked out nicely where like I get to have a good balance.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Yeah.</div>
        <div>Because freelancing full-time as a type designer is quite stressful.</div>
        <div class="neeta">They seem like very long-term projects, like designing a whole typeface.</div>
        <div> Yeah, yeah, if you're doing like a full on typeface like some people take like up to 10 years to complete an entire project. </div>
        <div class="neeta">Wow. </div>
        <div> You can take really long.</div>
        <div>
          I don't know I just - the pay honestly in this all is like, not the best if you're doing just typeface design, and if you're doing it independently, like it is a gamble.
          And I - as much as I wanted to take that gamble, you know, got bills to pay.
        </div>
        <div class="neeta">
          Yup, yup, exactly.
          Well, I don't want to take up too much more of your time and -
        </div>
        <div> It's cool. </div>
        <div class="neeta">
          I really, really enjoyed talking to you and I'm definitely going to send you a draft of the site, probably in a week when it's in a less embarrassing state, and you can take a look, and let me know what you think, if you want.
          But yeah, I'm excited. I think I kind of just wanted to be like an artifact of this call, and also just something that you really like and can also be like you know if you want to share it or whatever just, it'll live on the web.
        </div>
        <div>I'm like so honored that you even chose to do this with me.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Of course! Yeah, I've been, like I said I've really been wanting to talk to you, for months now, so I'm glad -</div>
        <div>Oh my gosh, I know, and I'm so sorry I like.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Oh that's okay - no -</div>
        <div>it has been like in the back of my mind, because I know I was supposed to get back to you, and then I didn't, I was like so embarrassed - </div>
        <div class="neeta">It was also like literally end of year, possibly worst time for trying to get in touch with people in general, so don't worry about it at all, </div>
        <div>Well, okay, um. It was really nice talking to you. I will send you everything right now as it's like fresh in my mind.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Thanks so much!</div>
        <div>Is there anything else that you need from me?</div>
        <div class="neeta">I don't think so, not right now, and if anything else comes up, then I will definitely shoot you a little note.</div>
        <div>Okay cool. Sounds good.</div>
        <div class="neeta">Thanks so much.</div>
        <div> Yeah, take care. It was nice to meet you. Bye -</div>
        <div class="neeta">You too, lovely to meet you. Good night.</div>
      </p>
