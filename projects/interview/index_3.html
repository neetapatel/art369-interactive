    <div class="interview">
      
      <p class="n">I have many questions I'd love to ask you, about your experience and your interest in type design, and then maybe I can show you the roughest of drafts I have going for the website for this interview.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Cool.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">I found out about you and your work through Instagram and the Internet. I've recently been interested in Gujarati type design. I don't really know anything about type design, but Gujarati is my family's language and I've been curious about that intersection. I remember I reached out to Tanvi Sharma to ask for advice and names of people, and she suggested that I get in touch with you. I love going on your Instagram. It's just, it's really hard, I think, to find reference points, at least from my corner of the world, on Gujarati type and Gujarati designers. I was curious if you could start off by telling me about how you started off in graphic design, or what led you to become a type designer. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Yeah, sure. I guess I've always been a pretty artistic person. Like since I was a kid. And I started doing design, or experimenting with design, when I was in the ninth grade, I think. I had a pirated version of Photoshop, which my dad just randomly gave to me one day. I had my own computer in my room, and he installed it. And I just started playing around with it, and literally the reason I wanted to do it was so that I could change the color of my eyes in photos . . . I was 14 years old, I wanted green eyes. So I was doing stupid shit like that.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">I was following all these online tutorials. I learned how to do a bunch of stuff like that, and then in high school I was the person everyone came to to make posters for events. I don't know if this happened to you when you were in high school, but when it was somebody's birthday, you decorated the lockers.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Oh yeah! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, we did do that.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Yeah, so I used to design the 8.5 x 11 pages for the whole locker for all my friends. I was yearbook editor in grade 12, and that was when I basically figured out, 'Oh, design is a thing. This is actually a job that people have in the real world.' Before that I thought I was going to go to journalism. I actually did co-op for journalism and photography.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Oh cool. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">That's where I learned how to do retouching and stuff like that. That was actually super helpful.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Yeah, get those green eyes really perfect.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Ha ha, yeah. And then yeah I was in my last year of high school when I found a program in Toronto. I don't know if you've ever heard of YSDN? That's the York Sheridan program. I think actually as of this year, it is done, like it's not going to be a program anymore, but it was basically a joint program with York University and Sheridan College. It was very hands on, but it was still at the university level. I was super interested in it. It was design-focused, there was no fine arts focus, which I really liked because I'm very bad at fine art skills (I never took art or anything). That's like what led me to that program. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">And then I actually really hated typography.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Oh, no way.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Yeah it was not my favorite class. I remember the first project we did I got the size wrong of the project, and I presented it. My prof tore me down, and I cried.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Oh no! That sounds awful.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Yeah. I was like, I'm over typography, this is not for me. But then when I was in my third year there was a typeface design course, and I was so intrigued by it because it's so different from typesetting. So I decided to check it out, and I really loved it. A big part of that was the prof that I had. She was very open-minded.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">I ended up asking her at the beginning of the semester, instead of designing a Latin font can I do Gujarati instead, because, I'm just more interested in that.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">And she didn't - she was white - so she didn't know anything about Gujarati. But she was very open to letting me explore it. That's how I started with typography or typeface design and Gujarati specifically.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Had you designed any Latin typefaces before that, or you just went straight into Gujarati?</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">I mean I've done bubble letters – that's probably as far as I had done. The typeface was awful because I had no resources. I didn't know where to even start with Gujarati.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">And it sounds like your professor wasn't necessarily the expert in the field on that one.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">No. She was great with Latin, but obviously not with Gujarati. I had a weird little process that I came up wit. And I found some books, but you know, looking at a book that's written in Gujarati isn't super informative if you don't know how to actually analyze it.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">That was how I got really interested in pursuing typeface design further because I was like, I know this isn't great, but I want to learn how to make it better.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Yeah, totally.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">I ended up doing an independent study in typeface design in my last year of university, as well. </p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Oh wow.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">That was really cool. It was about the history of, or the development of, the Gujarati script.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Okay.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="k">Again, I was pretty limited with resources. But I still got to learn a lot more.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="n">Totally. Was that a - did that culminate in some sort of paper or dissertation?</p>
