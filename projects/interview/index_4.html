  <div class="interview">
    
    <p class="n">I have many questions I&rsquo;d love to ask you, about your experience and your interest in type design, and then maybe I can show you the roughest of drafts I have going for the website for this interview.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Cool.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I found out about you and your work through Instagram and the Internet. I&rsquo;ve recently been interested in Gujarati type design. I don&rsquo;t really know anything about type design, but Gujarati is my family&rsquo;s language and I&rsquo;ve been curious about that intersection. I remember I reached out to Tanvi Sharma to ask for advice and names of people, and she suggested that I get in touch with you. I love going on your Instagram. It&rsquo;s just, it&rsquo;s really hard, I think, to find reference points, at least from my corner of the world, on Gujarati type and Gujarati designers. I was curious if you could start off by telling me about how you started off in graphic design, or what led you to become a type designer. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, sure. I guess I&rsquo;ve always been a pretty artistic person. Like since I was a kid. And I started doing design, or experimenting with design, when I was in the ninth grade, I think. I had a pirated version of Photoshop, which my dad just randomly gave to me one day. I had my own computer in my room, and he installed it. And I just started playing around with it, and literally the reason I wanted to do it was so that I could change the color of my eyes in photos . . . I was 14 years old, I wanted green eyes. So I was doing stupid shit like that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I was following all these online tutorials. I learned how to do a bunch of stuff like that, and then in high school I was the person everyone came to to make posters for events. I don&rsquo;t know if this happened to you when you were in high school, but when it was somebody&rsquo;s birthday, you decorated the lockers.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh yeah! I completely forgot about that. Yeah, we did do that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, so I used to design the 8.5 x 11 pages for the whole locker for all my friends. I was yearbook editor in grade 12, and that was when I basically figured out, &lsquo;Oh, design is a thing. This is actually a job that people have in the real world.&rsquo; Before that I thought I was going to go to journalism. I actually did co-op for journalism and photography.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh cool. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">That&rsquo;s where I learned how to do retouching and stuff like that. That was actually super helpful.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, get those green eyes really perfect.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Ha ha, yeah. And then yeah I was in my last year of high school when I found a program in Toronto. I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever heard of YSDN? That&rsquo;s the York Sheridan program. I think actually as of this year, it is done, like it&rsquo;s not going to be a program anymore, but it was basically a joint program with York University and Sheridan College. It was very hands on, but it was still at the university level. I was super interested in it. It was design-focused, there was no fine arts focus, which I really liked because I&rsquo;m very bad at fine art skills (I never took art or anything). That&rsquo;s like what led me to that program. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And then I actually really hated typography.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, no way.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah it was not my favorite class. I remember the first project we did I got the size wrong of the project, and I presented it. My prof tore me down, and I cried.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh no! That sounds awful.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. I was like, I&rsquo;m over typography, this is not for me. But then when I was in my third year there was a typeface design course, and I was so intrigued by it because it&rsquo;s so different from typesetting. So I decided to check it out, and I really loved it. A big part of that was the prof that I had. She was very open-minded.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I ended up asking her at the beginning of the semester, instead of designing a Latin font can I do Gujarati instead, because, I&rsquo;m just more interested in that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And she didn&rsquo;t - she was white - so she didn&rsquo;t know anything about Gujarati. But she was very open to letting me explore it. That&rsquo;s how I started with typography or typeface design and Gujarati specifically.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Had you designed any Latin typefaces before that, or you just went straight into Gujarati?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I mean I&rsquo;ve done bubble letters – that&rsquo;s probably as far as I had done. The typeface was awful because I had no resources. I didn&rsquo;t know where to even start with Gujarati.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">And it sounds like your professor wasn&rsquo;t necessarily the expert in the field on that one.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">No. She was great with Latin, but obviously not with Gujarati. I had a weird little process that I came up wit. And I found some books, but you know, looking at a book that&rsquo;s written in Gujarati isn&rsquo;t super informative if you don&rsquo;t know how to actually analyze it.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">That was how I got really interested in pursuing typeface design further because I was like, I know this isn&rsquo;t great, but I want to learn how to make it better.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, totally.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I ended up doing an independent study in typeface design in my last year of university, as well. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh wow.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">That was really cool. It was about the history of, or the development of, the Gujarati script.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Okay.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Again, I was pretty limited with resources. But I still got to learn a lot more.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Totally. Was that a - did that culminate in some sort of paper or dissertation?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Not a dissertation. It was, well, I guess, an essay essentially. But it was a design-like booklet type of thing.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh cool! If it&rsquo;s at all possible, or if you don&rsquo;t mind sharing that, I would love to learn about the development of that script.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p clas="n">But no pressure, I&rsquo;m just curious.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I&rsquo;ll see if I can find it. It was not super comprehensive. I can actually send you a dissertation on the development of the Gujarati script instead, by somebody who did it for their Master&rsquo;s.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, interesting.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">That one is very good. Mine was just . . . oh God, it almost felt like a high school project now that I think about it.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Both of those classes that I took got me really interested in typeface design. My prof told me about the grad program at Reading. I was really interested in it, and I ended up reaching out to the prof about applying and what my chances were of getting in. He was basically just like, um, you have potential, but you need more practice. So I ended up doing Type at Cooper.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, okay, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I did that in 2017 in preparation for applying to Reading.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Got it. Sounds like it worked.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, thankfully. This prof basically told me a bunch of things that I could do to get more experience and a better portfolio. And it took me about four years to get everything together that I wanted. That&rsquo;s how I ended up at Reading. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Wow.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">To get the guts to reapply properly this time. And then 2019 is when I did grad school, finished in the end of 2020.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Okay. It&rsquo;s a one-year program, or?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah it&rsquo;s a full - it&rsquo;s two years condensed, so it&rsquo;s a full one-year program.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Wow, that sounds really intense. What did you think of that experience as a whole? Sounds like you were there during part of the pandemic.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I got there six months before the pandemic started. It was really great when it was in person. It was a really small class. I think there were 12 of us to begin with. Very small, very intimate, and I had access to so many things I didn&rsquo;t have before - it was INSANE.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">The program is entirely devoted to type design, right?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yes.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Wow. That&rsquo;s really cool.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">You are creating a whole typeface with multiple styles, multiple languages, and you&rsquo;re also writing a dissertation towards the end of the program. It&rsquo;s very intense because it&rsquo;s a lot to do in such a short amount of time. But there&rsquo;s a ton of workshops and lectures and special guests and things like that, that we got to experience, which was really nice. Even through the pandemic and the switch to learning online . . . it was difficult, but we did the best we could, with what we had and it worked out.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, made the best of it.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah yeah it&rsquo;s a good - it was a good - I don&rsquo;t regret going. Had fun, even.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">That&rsquo;s amazing. I&rsquo;m curious also about - and I ask this as something trying to figure out or think about this - what your relationship to the Gujarati language is, and how it has changed as you dove into it through type design?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I&rsquo;m Gujarati as well, and I grew up speaking Gujarati mostly to my grandparents. Very basic. I was in Gujarati school from a young age, and I learned how to read and write.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, that&rsquo;s amazing. And this was in Canada, or?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. It was just Friday nights and then, when I was in high school, it was Saturday mornings. I only did it up until the 10th grade, I think.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Still, that sounds like a number of years.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, I did it for quite a long time, which makes it surprising that I&rsquo;m not more fluent in Gujarati, ha ha. It was always something that was around in some shape or form in my life. Part of the reason I also wanted to do typeface design and specifically focus on Gujarati was so I felt like I had more of a connection to my culture and the Indian - my Indian background - because I have always felt a little . . . not embarrassed but -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">You know, I&rsquo;m Indian. I feel like I should be able to speak Gujarati more, or be more fluent with it. This is my way of just connecting, I don&rsquo;t know, with that side of me. If I can&rsquo;t be super fluent in speaking Gujarati then I can at least design it, and I can learn how to read it even better.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah. &rsquo;At least&rsquo; being the understatement of the year there. It&rsquo;s such a big thing to be able to design that script.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It was something that I found I was good at, and that I enjoyed, so I was like, &rsquo;Okay well I can&rsquo;t speak it super well, but at least I can design it kind of well.&rsquo;</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Sure, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">But it&rsquo;s nice. Now, I can definitely read a lot quicker than I was able to before. I can even read Hindi because they&rsquo;re so similar. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It made me want to even watch Gujarati movies, which I never had an interest in before, but I was like, I wanna watch a Gujarati movie, and keep the subtitles on just so I can see if I can keep up with it. That kind of thing.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Wow. I can&rsquo;t express to you right now how much I empathize with everything you just said, of not being very fluent in Gujarati but it&rsquo;s all around me at home, and just all of it. Truly all of it. And then last semester, when I first - I was um - I forget how much I described to you what I was working on, but, basically, I was typesetting an essay by Gandhi in Gujarati.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Oh, okay.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I also did - nowhere near as much schooling as you - but a very little bit through the local mandir, and, um, I&rsquo;m not very good at reading, but just doing that typesetting and trying to figure out what the letters were, I feel like I&rsquo;m just even a little bit better at reading, and it&rsquo;s just so exciting - it feels like a real deep connection with a past that I don&rsquo;t really know anything about in terms of my parents, and it&rsquo;s sort of - it&rsquo;s so gratifying.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I&rsquo;m curious also how important you think it is to have, not even fluency in written language, but how important is a familiarity with it when you&rsquo;re working as a type designer in the script? Did you ever feel - did you feel very comfortable designing Gujarati right out of the gate, or did you feel some hesitancy?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I think because I was familiar with it, I felt very comfortable with it in a way that, at least once I got to grad school, my classmates who were designing maybe Hindi or Arabic for the first time didn&rsquo;t. They were not native speakers of that language. It is very helpful because there&rsquo;s small things about the language and the orthography that you inherently know if you&rsquo;ve learned even a little bit of it.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Right.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">You know, just things like the vowels and the placements - like that just makes sense to me because I&rsquo;ve grown up with it. I know that the ઈ can go on either side of the letter. And I know the difference between the two, and like why there&rsquo;s two ઈ characters and things like that. So like, being comfortable with it, and knowing it, I did find that to be an advantage, which was good.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. This is also like a pretty common topic I think in the type design industry, in general, if, like, you know, should designers be designing for languages that they have no connection to? It&rsquo;s kind of like a spicy topic. People have very strong opinions about it because, like, it&rsquo;s hard to find native designers for every single language.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">There are white designers who have made their entire career off of designing Hindi or Devanagari, right?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Right.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Two summers ago when everything happened with George Floyd, and all these racial conversation started happening, it was a really big issue. People were asking who should be designing typefaces for these languages?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I don&rsquo;t know if I have a stance on it, a very strong stance on it, but it definitely does help, when designing at least, if you&rsquo;re familiar.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah. You have an insight into how this thing functions on a very vernacular level, I guess.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Which can be really helpful. Do you think that conversation has kept up in type design in the last two years?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It has a little bit, but I do think it&rsquo;s died down the same way the other conversations that we were having around race at that time have died down. Which I find crazy. It sucks, but it&rsquo;s not a thing that people are focusing on anymore.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">From what I can see, there are more initiatives at least to get type design education in these more remote places. In Southeast Asia, for example, that was a big area where it was just white designers for the longest time, designing Thai or Burmese or whatever. And now there&rsquo;s some type design education that&rsquo;s happening in those areas.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Small steps, I guess.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">When I was getting into this whole subject area, I felt like you had a lot of references on Instagram of things you&rsquo;re looking at. I remember one post in particular was about a sari design. A picture of the fabric you posted. And I was like, oh my God, of course this is also design. And so I&rsquo;m curious to hear where you look for inspiration, and not necessarily just in designing typefaces, but design at large, inspiration and reference points.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Recently for type stuff I like to go to Letterform Archive. They have an online archive now which I find myself going to a lot if I want to browse type-related stuff. They have a really big catalog. For more of the Indian stuff, and the Gujarati, I have a lot of books of my own. Books that were passed down. Some of the sari stuff that you mentioned, those are just my mom&rsquo;s sari that I decided one day to take pictures of. I had a feeling one day I might reference these, in the future, for something.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">The last Instagram post was literally a picture I took of water drying on the ground.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, that almost looks like a painting.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah! I love the way that the water was making almost a gradient. It caught my eye. I end up taking a lot of random pictures out in the world because I think I may want to use this in something way down the line, who knows. I do try to reference from my environment.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It feels like a bit of a cheat code or whatever, but referencing mid-century designers –  they&rsquo;re so good. You can&rsquo;t go wrong when you&rsquo;re referencing them, right?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I also really like to reference textiles and ornamental architecture. Specifically floral inlays and stuff. I love that. Because it&rsquo;s so prevalent in Indian architecture, too.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, that&rsquo;s so interesting, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I have a book, I can send you the name of it, or send you a picture of, um -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I&rsquo;d love that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I reference that so much. I got it when I was at Type of Cooper. I went to the Met by myself one day and I found this book on Indian ornamental patterns - it was crazy! It was so cool.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">That sounds lovely. It&rsquo;s really, really nice - as I&rsquo;m just starting to get serious about my design education it&rsquo;s become clear that to cultivate some sort of base of where you look, particularly if you&rsquo;re stuck or something, is so critical. I just feel like it&rsquo;s a glaring hole in my life, and it&rsquo;s so lovely of you to share where you look.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Um, one of my last questions is: Do you - and I ask this in a very personal way - do you have advice for someone who is just getting into type design, has never really designed typefaces, and wants to design a Gujarati typeface? Ha ha. I feel very bewildered because it&rsquo;s such a huge world and I don&rsquo;t even know the fundamentals of Latin type design, which is my first language. Any advice about how to get started . . .</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yes, definitely! The first question I have, though, is are you also designing a companion Latin typeface, or just pure Gujarati?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">That&rsquo;s a good question. Well, I haven&rsquo;t really embarked on a project yet, and I won&rsquo;t formally do it until next year, like the second year of my program, and that will be a Latin typeface. It&rsquo;s gonna have to be. But, I just want to get a jumpstart and I don&rsquo;t have a clue how.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">For the Latin stuff, I can totally send you some resources. There&rsquo;s one book in particular that I used to use. I don&rsquo;t think I mentioned this: I also taught typeface design at my university. I ended up teaching part-time typography and typeface design. So I did my undergrad and I took typeface design, and then a couple years later I ended up coming back to teach in the same program.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh wow, very cool.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I taught typeface design, so I can send you a bunch of resources from that time. There&rsquo;s one book in particular that I recommend heavily for first time Latin typeface design. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Amazing.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">So I&rsquo;ll send that to you.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, thank you! That sounds like exactly what I need.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And then for Gujarati type design, um, I think the first thing you have to think about is, are you designing for display or are you designing for text? Display being a more ornamental or fun typeface.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And text being something that you would want to read large passages of text in. So that&rsquo;s the first thing. If you&rsquo;re doing display, there are so many things you can reference. I like to reference, for display design for Gujarati, book covers, the mid-century book covers! They&rsquo;re crazy, they&rsquo;re so good, they&rsquo;re -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Gujarati book covers?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah - </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Where do you find these??</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">There&rsquo;s a Flickr album that this typeface designer uploaded with a bunch of Gujarati book covers, but then she -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">No way!!</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">- also has a ton of other languages. She has Devanagari, Gurmukhi, Tamil, Telugu, all of this stuff, it&rsquo;s pretty crazy. I can send you a link to that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, that would be awesome.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I would recommend starting with the text because the base of that is Gujarati calligraphy, and Gujarati writing.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">When you know how to do Gujarati calligraphy, even the basic strokes that you would need and the angle at which the pen should be, that gives you such a good basis for the skeletons of the letters that you&rsquo;re going to design. Gujarati calligraphy was done with a reed pen.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">They were done with a reed pen that have that angle, right?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">So it&rsquo;s fat at moments, and then really thin in other moments?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. Do you know what the Pilot Parallel pens are?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, they&rsquo;re super flat, thick and flat, right?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. So Pilot Parallel pens are really good as well. I actually like to use highlighters.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh! Ha ha.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Because they are cut at the perfect angle, there’s that chisel tip -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">That is a good angle, and then I hold it like a pen, like where the correct angle should be, and then I draw on paper using that because it&rsquo;s such an easy way to experiment, and it&rsquo;s low pressure.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Right, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It&rsquo;s just a highlighter. You&rsquo;re not using pen and ink. On Instagram I have a little guide for -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh no way.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">- Gujarati, for starting with - let me find it.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yes.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">So it&rsquo;s the - I&rsquo;ll just send it to you.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">This two-pencil method - that is actually something that I use a lot. Literally taping together two pencils because you can create whichever angle you need.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh wow this is so - um - lo-fi. Also, very cute guide.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, ha ha. So I think the last, or one of the last -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">This is awesome.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, so in the third slide, the third square, um the 36 degrees. So that&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re holding your pen like if you were to line up the two ends of your pencil tips with that angle like that&rsquo;s how you would want to keep the pencils, or like whatever writing utensil that you&rsquo;re using.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And that&rsquo;s essentially the starting point for writing in the Gujarati script.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">A big mistake that a lot of people make when they try to learn Gujarati calligraphy, or like calligraphy in other languages that don&rsquo;t follow what like Latin does, is they use the Latin angle, which is essentially the exact opposite of what you need for Gujarati, so then your thicks and thins are in the wrong place.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh wow.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And then it ends up looking like very weird, it&rsquo;s like a Romanized or Latinized version of Gujarati that like isn&rsquo;t super true to how it works.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">So interesting. How important do you think it is to be good at drawing or calligraphy? I&rsquo;m not very skilled this.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It&rsquo;s not super important. It&rsquo;s more just like you, if you understand how the letters work and how the letters should be formed, like understanding the structure and the way the letters should be formed is more important than like being able to draw it perfectly because you can always like go back in with your pencil after and like, you know, fix it, erase what didn&rsquo;t work or, like, if you&rsquo;re working digitally you can very easily fix those things. It&rsquo;s more about like, &rsquo;Okay, I got the general placement of the thicks and thins in the right spots. So I&rsquo;d say like yeah, because I&rsquo;m not like, I said I&rsquo;m not -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Ha ha, yeah I was thinking about -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I&rsquo;m not an artist.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Ha ha, sounds familiar. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">So if you can just familiar with that . . . I know it&rsquo;s so difficult to just like explain over video it&rsquo;s so much easier to show you.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, but even this diagram on this post is so helpful.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, I&rsquo;ll send you like, whatever I can, with the calligraphy stuff. The other thing I would say to do is like just find a typeface. Even maybe an old one from a book or something that you could just start copying in like Glyphs or something, just to like get you familiar with how to like place points for like doing vector drawing for typeface design.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Mm hmm.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And then it&rsquo;ll also help you to just be like a character study of like all the different letters that you have to design.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Right.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, what else?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah, that sounds good. Copying. That sounds like a lot less, um, I&rsquo;m just feeling like a lot of pressure about like oh my God, if I start this like project it&rsquo;s going to have to be something worth doing, but like you got to learn some how, basically.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I can yeah I would I would start like yeah with copying and like there&rsquo;s a like a core set of characters that you can start with that&rsquo;ll give you a lot of what you need to design the rest of the letters. So don&rsquo;t feel like you have to start like from ક and then do every single letter.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Okay.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">What you can do instead is like - so we call them proof of concept, where you would just do like a sample. Like of you know, maybe like 10 to 15 letters and it&rsquo;ll give you like the DNA of the font, right? And that&rsquo;s just like a very easy way to explore like different ideas you have, rather than like doing a full typeface, and it does show like a wider range of skill as well.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">That smaller set?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I think like - I don&rsquo;t know if this is applicable to you because - I don&rsquo;t think - I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever like - want to go to like grad school for typeface design or anything, but like I know a lot of students in typeface design or like that want to go into typeface design think they need to have designed like a FULL typeface with like every single like punctuation, every single letter possible, and all of that, but like really like it&rsquo;s just about showing - it&rsquo;s better to show range and that you&rsquo;ve thought about like designing a typeface, that is, is for like display, one that is for text, one that has a lot of contrast, one that maybe doesn&rsquo;t. And so yeah, I just recommend doing that because, like you get a lot more exposure to different styles.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Right, yeah, you can sort of "end" things a little quicker and move on to the next idea almost.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, because it&rsquo;s more important to do that, rather than like . . . what are you going to do with a fully finished Gujarati typeface? That is probably not, you know, you&rsquo;re probably not going to sell it, right? If you&rsquo;re just making it as a learning tool. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many type faces I have that I started that . . . yeah yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">But no, oh my God, I feel like I&rsquo;m rambling about -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh no, I&rsquo;m so happy to hear it. Don&rsquo;t worry about it. This is all fantastic.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Um, yeah, maybe um let me show you - uh - what I have going for this site so far, and it&rsquo;s like - I cannot express how sketchy it is - ha ha. It is bound to change a million times, but um. I was sort of thinking - please excuse the horrendous typography on this page - Actually, this is the second idea I had. The first idea I had was - if you&rsquo;re interested at all - I thought it could be cool to make this, like I mentioned, a very type-heavy little website, but also to showcase like a Gujarati typeface you&rsquo;ve worked on, or something you&rsquo;re interested in, in that realm. Um, so this is just like a random Google font - actually the font is called Shrikhand, which I thought was really fun, super display - but um, anyway, so I like this idea of having these little cards, with all the letters and then maybe I&rsquo;ll fit in the content sort of on separate cards - like this is the beginning of a card - OR have content on the flip side and there&rsquo;s like a hover state. At least when you&rsquo;re on desktop.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah and this I just pulled off your Instagram real quick to see what it would be like to have little images of like things that inspire you or like even like a link to Letterform Archive, or something like, that, interspersed. And this would be like responsive for mobile . . .  </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">And then the other idea I had is - I&rsquo;m kind of sad in that designe to not be able to just like read our conversation. Especially because, as someone who&rsquo;s found it hard to find conversation about Gujarati type design, it would be cool to just have it all in one place.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah and so, then I was thinking about doing something more like a traditional typesetting of the whole interview, and then on the sidebar maybe these like individual consonants click out to like - say you click જ, it clicks out to like some point in the article that maybe relates to the sound of જ or something. Or even not necessarily a logical connection, but just this thing takes you through the interview in maybe a more unexpected way.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah! </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Which is kind of what this thing - this thing takes you through the interview in a very unexpected way, and this thing is little more traditional.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">So I guess I&rsquo;m trying to find some in-between.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah I mean I think those are both great ideas. Um. I do have a typeface, like I can give you the typeface that I worked on for my Master&rsquo;s -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Is this Mango?!</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Ha, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Ha ha, sorry not to be a total creep.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">No no no, that&rsquo;s cool. Um yeah that one is not fully done, but like I have the full basic alphabet that you would need, so I can give that to you.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">That sounds awesome! The other thing our conversation just before reminded me of is if there was a typeface that you want started and didn&rsquo;t finish, like maybe it would be interesting to have an incomplete set of letters on there? But just totally your call.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, I mean I definitely do. Actually, I do have like a display type basically that I started in Gujarati, like I did it just as proof of concept for my for my Master&rsquo;s, so I could share that with you. The letters are very random.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Cool, that could be interesting, I don&rsquo;t - yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">It is kind of nice how ક and Keya just work out at the top of the page, so that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;m like kind of anchored to.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">But the name Mango is such a good name for a typeface.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Oh my God, thank you, I thought it was gonna be so cheesy like -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">No! How did you come up with it?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">- what a diaspora ass name. But I justify it because the counters in the Latin are purposely like uneven, kind of like a mango.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Interesting, interesting.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">So you designed like a Latin counterpart, as well as the Gujarati. Is that sort of what is standard in type design?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Well, it was a requirement in the program.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh, okay.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">To design like a Latin typeface and then the companion font in whatever language or languages, you wanted to design them in.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">But generally it&rsquo;s become more of a thing in the type world now to like to be more inclusive with like, even just your Latin character set. Like the basic like languages or regions that they would cover is like - I think it was like Eastern Europe. Like the those languages that have like diacritics and stuff. But now it&rsquo;s becoming more common practice to include like diacritics for things like Vietnamese because, like that&rsquo;s a very underserved, or was a very underserved community for typeface design.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I don&rsquo;t know how much you know about Vietnamese, but like they have like diacritics that like stack. So you might have like two or three diacritics that are stacked on like one letter so like people were just very, I don&rsquo;t know, impatient, maybe is the right word. It&rsquo;s a lot of work, right? Now the conversation has shifted to being like, &rsquo;You have to put in the work if you want to be inclusive with your work, right? And not just leave out a whole population of people that need to be able to read their language.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I mean generally like - it&rsquo;s not like - because I wanted to just release like Mango Gujarati by itself, but I spoke with somebody who&rsquo;s in the industry, and he was like you can, the likelihood of people buying just the Gujarati typeface without the English companion is like pretty low. It does make sense from like a more logical standpoint. If you&rsquo;re typesetting something, you would probably want to have the matching Latin because English is like THE language now of the world.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Do you work like totally professionally in type design now, or do you also do other forms of design work?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">No, actually. The only time I was working full-time in typeface design is when I was interning right after grad school. I did like a six-month internship doing typeface design, but after that - I&rsquo;m actually a brand designer now for a startup.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, so I do that full-time, but I actually do quite a bit of type design within this, so -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Like within that branding project?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh cool.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And then I do like freelance work as well, so I&rsquo;ve been able to keep up with doing type design, in that way and, like, I have a lot of South Asian clients.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh that&rsquo;s so awesome, yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It&rsquo;s worked out nicely where like I get to have a good balance.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yeah.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Because freelancing full-time as a type designer is quite stressful.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">They seem like very long-term projects, like designing a whole typeface.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, yeah, if you&rsquo;re doing like a full on typeface like some people take like up to 10 years to complete an entire project. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Wow. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">You can take really long.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I don&rsquo;t know I just - the pay honestly in this all is like, not the best if you&rsquo;re doing just typeface design, and if you&rsquo;re doing it independently, like it is a gamble.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">And I - as much as I wanted to take that gamble, you know, got bills to pay.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Yup, yup, exactly.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Well, I don&rsquo;t want to take up too much more of your time and -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">It&rsquo;s cool. </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I really, really enjoyed talking to you and I&rsquo;m definitely going to send you a draft of the site, probably in a week when it&rsquo;s in a less embarrassing state, and you can take a look, and let me know what you think, if you want.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">But yeah, I&rsquo;m excited. I think I kind of just wanted to be like an artifact of this call, and also just something that you really like and can also be like you know if you want to share it or whatever just, it&rsquo;ll live on the web.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">I&rsquo;m like so honored that you even chose to do this with me.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Of course! Yeah, I&rsquo;ve been, like I said I&rsquo;ve really been wanting to talk to you, for months now, so I&rsquo;m glad -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Oh my gosh, I know, and I&rsquo;m so sorry I like.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Oh that&rsquo;s okay - no -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">it has been like in the back of my mind, because I know I was supposed to get back to you, and then I didn&rsquo;t, I was like so embarrassed - </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">It was also like literally end of year, possibly worst time for trying to get in touch with people in general, so don&rsquo;t worry about it at all, </p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Well, okay, um. It was really nice talking to you. I will send you everything right now as it&rsquo;s like fresh in my mind.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Thanks so much!</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Is there anything else that you need from me?</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">I don&rsquo;t think so, not right now, and if anything else comes up, then I will definitely shoot you a little note.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Okay cool. Sounds good.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">Thanks so much.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="k">Yeah, take care. It was nice to meet you. Bye -</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p class="n">You too, lovely to meet you. Good night.</p>
