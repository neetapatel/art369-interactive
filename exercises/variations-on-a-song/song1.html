        One day when we’re older, this might come clear.<br>
        Looking over my shoulder when nothing’s there at all.<br>
        I made mountains of molehills and lingered in them for hours.<br>
        And when the moment was over, I tried to find a universe so small.<br> 
        <small>(A universe so small)</small>

        We walked on the rooftops, and saw the people below us.<br>
        And thinking they were alone there, they laid their conscience clean.<br>
        Not wanting to eavesdrop, we shuffled into the shadows.<br>
        And climbing down from the top, I saw windows like a thousand eyes at night.<br>
        Their eyes were full of light.<br>
